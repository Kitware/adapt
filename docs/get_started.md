# Getting started with ADAPT

A good entry point into exploring the ADAPT processing software without requiring a flyable ADAPT payload is provided by the tutorial: [ADAPT Processing of AirSim Data](https://gitlab.kitware.com/adapt/adapt/-/tree/master/doc/airsim_docker.md). This tutorial uses [Microsoft AirSim](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/) as a drone sensor emulator running alongside ADAPT processes within a fully Dockerized environment. Camera images along with associated ground-truth depth and semantic segmentation images are rendered and saved to disk as you navigate a simulated drone with your keyboard through a forested mountain landscape. The pairing of raw imagery with ground truth allows training a semantic segmentation deep-neural-network model using ADAPT training tools. Finally, the trained model is deployed to process AirSim imagery in real time.
