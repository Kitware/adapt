# Example Missions

The ADAPT payload is a general-purpose tool for optimized data collection and aerial deployment of real-time deep-neural-network image processing. A variety of missions can be supported simply by training mission-specific image-processing models. Georegistered analytics are wirelessly transmitted to a ground station computer and beyond, supporting missions where timely dissemination of results is critical.
