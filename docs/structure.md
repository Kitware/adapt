# Structure of the ADAPT payload

At this phase of the project, we are focused on developing and refining one concrete implementation of the ADAPT payload and sensor stack with an emphasis on low-cost components, clear documentation, and tutorials so that the project is approachable and the system's utility becomes clear to a wider audience of potential users. Currently, support is focused on the [NVIDA Jetson](https://developer.nvidia.com/buy-jetson) Xavier and Nano edge computers
and the primary sensing package provided by the [Advanced Navigation Spatial GPS/INS](https://www.advancednavigation.com/products/spatial).

In support of the open-source nature of this project, we leverage the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/). ROS provides a rich ecosystem of out-of-the-box capabilities for interfacing with a wide array of cameras and sensors as well as common autonomous-system processing.
